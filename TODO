TODO


Programming:
- Talk to Eike about attributes? (do not work for all datasets (o/s is not accepted)) (register alias in pint to map to another unit (before read snirf))
- Do we need to include this into cedalion fast? (dependency issues very likely)
- Debugging for pretraining and embedding extraction works nice
- Automate complete training and embedding extraction + hyperparameter search



Model:
- Add a learnable convolutional layer
- Does feature exclusion also work for testing data?
- Exclude short channels from denoising?
- How to determine location based on xarray?
- Go through other parameters

Additional work:
- State space models! (Paper found that is able to create latent embeddings from SSM)


Testing data:
- How to cut data for testing?
- Can we use multiple datasets? If yes, how do we configure the order between datasets?
- On adding HRF (how much time between stimulus do we need?)
- Should we just pad to a constant for our experiments?
- If we remove noisy channels and fill with 0, can we also pad with 0?
- No frequency filtering done so far


Evaluation:
- Center / whiten embeddings for PCA?



TODO: Check how many channels
- Ask Meryem about different channel sizes of the datasets (is the smaller one a subset of the bigger one)
    - Are the sources and detector labels aligned (the same position on the head)
    - BEFORE THAT CHECK NUMBER OF SOURCES AND DETECTORS (CHECK IF THERE ARE ONLY SOME MORE CONNECTIONS)



Sliding window size:
100 seconds * sample rate (Hz) (50 seconds could be fine)



Cluster: Should be used

Implement: Convolutional layer

Train test split
- we can finetune on fnirs subjects later (single-shot)
- Blocks: See sliding window size
- Create the blocks and leave them out 
- Dont use subsample


- Use index for blocks not subject!
- Classification as evaluation results
- Correlation vs RMSE
- Focus on the hardening part

- SHAP explainability




# TODO Today:
- Adjust o/s with registering
- Find out sampling rate (hz) of datasets
- Check positions of channels / number of sources and detectors
- Create training and test split (careful, sliding window but not on test blocks)


# TODO Weekend:
- Guarantee that we have all datasets
-
